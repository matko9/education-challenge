Education challenges
====================

This is a repository with educational challenges for programers. All challenges are located under challange directory
and each of them contains file `test.php` and directory `solution`. When `test.php` is executed it loads a solution
and uses it as a library to test it's functionality. All tests are prefixed by a two digit number representing
their dificutly.  

To pass the challange you must create your own solution that will pass the test. What it is expected from a
solution to do and how it is interacted with you can find by view the `test.php` file.  

If you execute `test.php` with your solution and it is a success then you passed the challenge. Best luck!
